// should mix view and mix edit be the same component. 

// top of the page show the mix and the mix details 
// the lower part of the page shows the tracks mapped 

// footer at the bottom of the page




// thinking about a separate component for mix create or edit. when you click on any of your mixes, you're automatically in  mix create edit mode. when you click on anyone else's mix, you're automatically in mix view mode. 

// OR, can I figure out how to say if userid matches the userid on the mix, show these buttons and call these functions <--- this feels like the route I should go instead of having everything look identical. This way as well, if I add an admin user, they will always see these buttons.
